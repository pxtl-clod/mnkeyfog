# AGENTS.md

See [CONTRIB.md](CONTRIB.md) for coding style guide. Read and follow CONTRIB.md
before writing code.

See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for the TODO list (if there is any, some tasks will be
controlled from other mechanisms).  Delete items from the TODO list when
complete.  Each major TODO heading should be implemented as its own PR with its
own branch from main.

# Dev Environment

Codebase is using dotnet 10.0.  Use `dotnet build` to compile, and 

```sh
dotnet run --project mnkeyfog/tests/MnkeyFog.Model.Tests
```

to run unit test suite.

# Testing

Unit tests are in `tests/MnkeyFog.Model.Tests`.

Do not attempt automated testing on the command-line tool. Test improvement can
be achieved by codifying more logic into model.

## Testing Warning about Out Of Memory

Note that in the event of a stack overflow, `dotnet test` can start failing with
OOM.  In that case, clear `/tmp`.  Also `dotnet run` the test project reduces
likelihood of OOM and still runs the tests.  You may have to use `top` and
`kill` to clear out orphaned dotnet processes.

# Refactoring

Do not attempt to refactor or otherwise clean-up the code unless specifically
instructed to do so. Do not remove comments unless they are untrue.

# Scratch space

Create any needed working files such as to-do lists within the `temp` dir, which is gitignored.
